Higher-Order Components (HOCs) are functions that take in a component as an argument and return a new component with additional functionality. HOCs are a useful pattern for reusing component logic and implementing cross-cutting concerns, such as authentication and authorization, caching, logging, and error handling. They allow for extracting common functionality into a separate component and apply it to multiple components without duplicating code.
